This was a good assignment that I enjoyed. I liked doing the CSS for this and learning new tricks.

Objectives

    Understand how state drives changes to an interface in React
    Respond to user events in React
    Understand and use REST APIs
    Use React lifecycle methods
    Understand and interpret API documentation
    Use fetch or axios to perform POST request

    Requirements

Read over the documentation for the API we will be using:

https://minesweeper-api.herokuapp.com/

You will need to interpret the response and render a graphical user interface. The API results include an array of arrays (two-dimensional array). These represent rows and columns. These are probably best translated into table rows (<tr>) and table data (<td>) cells.

Setup

    Create a button to create a new game. Use the animated gif above as a user interface guide. Do at least that much, but also feel free to have fun.
    Style the cells appropriately.
    Left-clicking a cell performs the check action
    Right/secondary clicking a cell performs the flag action
    When the game status changed to won or lost a victory or failure message - Do not use alert for this. Update the user interface.
